two test programs: cuckoo_test and lsh_test

cuckoo_test:
used to test cuckoo hashing
compile：gcc cuckoo_test.c cuckoo.c -o cuckoo_test
usage：./cuckoo_test trace_file table_num func_num size1:size2:...:sizen max_steps 
trace_file：trace file, generated by string_generator
table_num: the number of hash tables
func_num: the number of hash functions, default is 8
size1:size2:...:sizen：the size of each hash tables
max_steps：max steps of kick out operation


lsh_test:
used to test lsh
compile：gcc lsh_test.c lsh.c -lm -o lsh_test
usage：./lsh_test trace_file  config_file
trace_file: trace file，generated by vectors_generator
config_file: lsh configuration file，default is lsh.conf

nest_test:
used to tet nest
compile：gcc nest_test.c nest.c lsh.c cuckoo.c -lm -o nest_test
usage: ./nest_test trace_file
trace_file: trace file，generated by vectors_generator
default configuration file is nest.conf
